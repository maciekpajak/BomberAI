Q-learning based bot
------

Train bot based on Q-learning:

.. code:: sh

    python qlearning.py

Model compile

.. code:: python

    def compile(self,get_reward: Callable[[bool, Action, bool, bool, int, int], float],
            state_type: str,state_range: int, min_enemy_dist: int, learning_rate=0.1,
            discount=0.98, epsilon=0.1, de=0.01, gamma=0.9, n_past_states=10) -> None:

Game settings

You can change game settings during training 

.. code:: python

    def set_game(self, grid: np.ndarray, en1_alg: Algorithm, en2_alg: Algorithm, en3_alg: Algorithm,
            box_density: int | Tuple[int, int] = 5, shuffle_positions: bool = True, max_playing_time=120) -> None:

Fit

.. code:: python

    def fit(self, epochs: int = 10, episodes: int = 1000, start_epoch: int = 0, show_game: bool = False,
            path_to_save: str = 'qtable.csv', log_file: str = 'log.csv') -> pd.DataFrame:
